This project aimed to classify consumer data into segments using machine learning. Two models, Decision Tree and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated. The Decision Tree achieved perfect accuracy, while the Random Forest demonstrated strong performance. Feature importance analysis revealed key variables for classification. Further optimization and analysis are recommended for deeper insights into consumer behavior.
